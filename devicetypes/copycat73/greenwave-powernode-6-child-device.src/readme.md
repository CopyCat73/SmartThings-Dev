## Installation

### Greenwave Powernode Installation Procedure

#### Step One: Install the code using the SmartThings IDE

1. In the SmartThings IDE, click '*My Device Handlers*', then '*+ Create New Device Handler*'. 
2. Select the '*From Code*' tab and paste in the contents of the groovy files found here (the powernode 6 and child files).
3. Click '*Create*', and then '*Publish*' *(For Me)* for both files.

#### Step Two: Add the powernode

1. Using the SmartThings app on your phone, click the "+" symbol on the "my home" tab.
2. The "add a thing" screen appears. Click the learn button on the side of the switch three times in a row. 
3. After (quite) some time the powernode itself and the six individual switches will be added. 
4. The individual switches are numbered 1-6, where number one is at the power cord side and 6 near the power button.
